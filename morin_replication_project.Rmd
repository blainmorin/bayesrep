# Background and Overview 

This project replicates the difference-in-differences model estimated in Qiu and Gopalakrishnan's 2018 paper, "Shoreline defense against climate change and capitalized impact of beach nourishment" using a Bayesian framework [(link to paper)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeem.2018.08.013). The paper evaluates the impact of beach nourishment (which is "the process of replacing an eroding section of a beach with sand dredged from inlets or offshore sand reserves") on coastal housing prices. The analysis focuses on on island in the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Here is the map of the area analyzed for reference:

```{r, out.width = "32%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("beach.PNG") 
```

In the analysis, the authors compare the trend in sale prices of homes in Nags Head (the town that received beach nourishment) to the trend of sale prices in Duck and Kitty Hawk (which are towns that didn't receive beach nourishment until a few years after Nags Head). Here, receiving the beach nourishment is considered the treatment. The authors' diff-in-diff model takes the form:

$$ ln(P_{ijt}) = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1X_i + \beta_1Nourish + \beta_2PostNourish  + \beta_3Nourish*PostNourish + \eta_j + \zeta_t + \epsilon_{ijt}   $$
where $P_{ijt}$ is the price of home $i$ in location $j$ sold in year $t$. $X_i$ is a vector of control variables for housing characteristics. $Nourish$ is an indicator variable for being in the treatment group. The main coefficient of interest is $\beta_3$, which is the average treatment effect of beach nourishment. The authors also include census block group and year fixed effects ($\eta_j$ and $\zeta_t$ respectively). 

# OLS Estimation Results

In the published paper, the authors use year fixed effects as well as seasonal fixed effects. Including the year fixed effect causes collinearity problems when I try to replicate their analysis (in other words the year fixed effects are collinear with the $PostNorish$ covariate, which is an indicator variable that = 1 when the year is greater than 2010). I also tried to filter the data based on the authors description, but am not able to exactly match their sample size. OLS regression results are presented in Table 1.  

```{r}

df1 = df %>%
  filter(sale_year >= 2008) %>%
  filter(sale_year <= 2014) %>%
  filter(dist_Shoreline_m < 2000) %>%
  mutate(Nourish = ifelse(city == "NAGS HEAD", 1, 0)) %>%
  mutate(PostNourish = ifelse(sale_year > 2010, 1, 0)) %>%
  mutate(age = sale_year - year_built) %>%
  mutate(sale_year = as.factor(sale_year)) %>%
  mutate(Nourish = as.factor(Nourish)) %>%
  mutate(PostNourish = as.factor(PostNourish))
  

```

```{r}

model1 = lm(log(price) ~ bathroom + sqft + I(sqft^2) + age + stry + I(dist_Shoreline_m / 10) + OceanFront + Nourish*PostNourish + as.factor(blkgrp), data = df1)

```

```{r, results='asis', eval=FALSE}

stargazer(model1, header = FALSE,
          title = "OLS Regression Results",
          single.row = TRUE,
          add.lines = list(c("Location Fixed Effects?", "Yes"), c("Year Fixed Effects?", "No")),

# Bayesian Estimation Results

In this section, I replicate the analysis using rstan. Here is the specification in the .stan file:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

data {
  int<lower=0> N;
  int<lower=1> K;
  matrix[N,K] x;
  vector[N] y;
}

parameters {
  vector[K] beta;
  real<lower=0> sigma;
}

model {
  y ~ normal(x * beta, sigma);
}



```

This model was run with 4 chains, each with 2000 iterations. A flat prior was used because of lack of prior information. The x matrix contains all of the housing covariates as well as the year and location fixed effects. Table 2 presents the summary results for the non-fixed effect variables.

```{r}

pricemodel = model.frame(log(price) ~ bathroom + sqft + I(sqft^2) + age + stry + I(dist_Shoreline_m / 10) + OceanFront + Nourish*PostNourish + as.factor(blkgrp), data = df1)

price.data = list(y = model.response(pricemodel), x = model.matrix(pricemodel, pricemodel))
price.data$N = nrow(price.data$x)
price.data$K = ncol(price.data$x)

```

```{r}
# options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())
# price.fit = stan("ols.stan", data = price.data, seed = 134, iter = 4000, chains = 4)
# save(price.fit, file = "finalmodel5")

load("finalmodel5")

price.fit.summary = round(summary(price.fit)$summary, 4)
price.fit.summary = as.data.frame(price.fit.summary)

term = c(colnames(price.data$x), "sigma", "lp__")

price.fit.summary = cbind(term, price.fit.summary)

df2 = price.fit.summary %>%
  select(term, mean, sd, n_eff, Rhat)

df2 = df2[c(1:10, 21:23),]

df3 = df2 

df3$term = c(
            "Constant",
            "# of Bathrooms",
            "Living Area (100 Sqft)",
            "Living Area Squared",
            "Age of Property (Years)",

            "Sigma",
            "lp_"
          )

df3 %>%
  kable(booktabs = T, row.names = FALSE, linesep = "", caption = "Bayesian Estimation Results") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position")

```


```{r}

```

Looking at the summary results in Table 2, the effective sample and chain mixing (seen in the n_eff and Rhat columns, respectively) are sufficient for all variables. The estimated coefficients are also similar to the OLS specification.

```{r, fig.height=9}

grid.arrange(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, ncol = 2, top = "Figure 1: MCMC Tracplots")

```

Figure 1 plots the MCMC chains for the variables of interest. As expected, the chains are mixing well and are bouncing around a narrow area.
